## Description

As developers, we tend to have certain sites we like, as references
for documentation, resources, tutorials, etc. This project is quite
straightforward: you input some keywords and it searches using the
powerful Google Search Engine on a curated subset of the internet.

In all honesty, I don't think this project is as useful as I
imagined it to be. Mostly because Google actually puts a character limit on
search queries. Due to that limitation, I can't search a bigger
list of sites as I would have liked.
